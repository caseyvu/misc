Collection of my code for my miscellaneous toy projects

# Advent Of Code 2015
Here is the archive of Meow's solutions for Advent of Code 2015 (http://adventofcode.com/) 

The questions and input files are archived in folder *questions* and *inputs*

If the code needs an input file, run as follow:
```
./dayX.py inputs/dayXinput.txt
```

If the code does not need an input file, run as follow:
```
./dayX.py
```

(with X=the number of the day, from 1 to 25)
